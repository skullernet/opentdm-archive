Minor
-----
Force to spectator idle players in warmup.

Get free as in speech .wav files for hit sounds.

Web configs creation.

Votable hit sounds as well as per-player config.

Normal
------
Variable scoreboards, player can choose which they prefer. Default to some
similar to gxmod / battle or whatever people vote on.

Preferences system tied to guid, looks up preferenes (team name, skin, score
board style, hitsounds, etc) from opentdm.net.

Preserve teams on match end / map change (this will be more work than it seems
due to the teamplayers setup).

Use teamplayers instead of current clients for scoreboard and any other match
related info.

Big
---
Web stats system. End of match, stats for players with a guid are POSTed with
libcurl to opentdm.net for some horribly big nasty stats / ranking system.
